  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Forena is a report writing tool that is designed to help
    developers who are knowledgeable in writing SQL.</p>
  <p>Report definitions are stored as files on the file system in
    .frx files. These files are basically extended XHTML template files.
    Report authors need only to learn a few special attributes and tags
    (e.g. frx:block frx:foreach) to create reports in virtually any
    layout. Frx report files are typically stored in a location writable
    by the web user, so that they can be authored using a WYSIWYG report
    editor. Report definitions can typically be modified by a group of
    power users. These users do not need to know SQL, but should be
    comfortable in html/css.</p>
  <p>Data are typically accessed through "data blocks" which are
    basically references to parameterized sql files. The .sql data
    blocks are stored on the file system, typically in a location that
    is not writable by the web user.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This guide documents how to install, configure and maintain
    forena as well as how to leverage the power of other drupal modules
    to enhance Forena's capabilities.</p>
