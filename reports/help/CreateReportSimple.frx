    <h2>Add Report</h2>
    <p>To create a report, select the Add Report from your
      Navigation menu. Site administrators can relocate this menu so
      contact your site administrator if you have trouble finding it.</p>
    <p>
      The <b>Report Name</b> is a unique name that is used as the base
      file name for your report. In this example will use a title
      test/simple. This will mean that the filename of the report will
      be test/simple.frx.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Title</b>field indicates the title of the report as it will
      appear for the user. In this example we'll call our report "Test
      Simple Report".
    </p>
    <p>For a simple report, you can leave the remaining fields
      blank, and hit save. The report body will be generated when we add
      data to our report.</p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      After saving your report, you will be taken directly to the data
      tab. In the <strong>Data Block</strong> field, specify a data
      source to be used on the report. You may search for the name of
      any provided data blocks. These data blocks are created or
      installed by your site administrator or developer. For this
      report, we'll reference one of the sample queries provided with
      forena. Enter sampledb/users_by_state and press <strong>Preview</strong>.
      Forena will show you a sample table layout of the data returned by
      that data block. You may need to specify required parameters in a
      report in order to gernate sample data before forena will be able
      to store your report preview. You will be able to cusotmize the
      columns and layout later. Press <strong>Add </strong>to add this
      data to the report.
    </p>
    <p>The preview shows the format of the data that will be added
      to the report. If parameters were required in order for the data
      block to return any data, you'll be prompted to enter the
      parameters. You cannot use the editor to add data to the report
      unless you can provide parameters that cause the query to actually
      return data.</p>
