    <p>Specify the data you want to include in your report. Data
      blocks are typically provided by developers or site
      administrators. Each data block corresponds to a specific query to
      a database or application. To add data to an existing report,
      specify the Data Block and a Template and choose Preview. If the
      Data Block requires parameters you'll be prompted for them in the
      Parameters field set.</p>
    <p>Keep pressing Preview until you see the data that you're
      expecting in the report below. Don't worry if the preview shows
      too many fields, or isn't quite in the right format. You'll be
      able to control that in the Layout tab later.</p>
    <p>At this point in time you may select a template to decide the
      basic look and field of the data that you are adding to the
      report. Feel free to experiment with these options to get a report
      that looks as close as possible to the design you are looking for.
      Again you will be able to customize these layouts by editing the
      .frx files or using the layout tab of the report editor.</p>
    <p>If you need to remove a data section from the report, you can
      check the checkboxes next to the Data Block that is currently
      being displayed and press save.</p>
