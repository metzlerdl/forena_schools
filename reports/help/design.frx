	<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>Forena reports are defined using the Forena Report Xml template
		format (frx).&#xA0; The template format is largely an XHTML document
		which is extended by some custom HTML tags and attributes.&#xA0; The
		result should be something familiar to anyone that uses html.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Where are reports stored?</strong>
	</p>
	<p>Reports are stored as files on your reporting server, and may be
		edited with a text editor directly, or via a user interface provided
		by forena.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>A Simple Report:</strong>
	</p>
	<p>The following example illustrates a very simple report:</p>
<html frx:renderer="FrxSource">
  <head>
  <title>A sample report</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div frx:block="sampledb/states">
      <p frx:foreach="*">{code} - {name}</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
<p>There are basically three custom tags that appear in the simplest
	version of the report:</p>
<p>
	<strong>xmlns:frx element</strong>- This defines the document as a
	Forena Report XML template document.&#xA0; It should appear exactly
	this way in the document.
</p>
<p id="block">
	<strong>frx:block attribute</strong> - This tells forena to load data
	from the defined data block (in this case sample/sampleXML.&#xA0; Data
	blocks are usually parameterized queries. If you are a developer, you
	might want to read more about defining data blocks in the Forena Data
	source.
</p>
<p id="foreach">
	<strong>frx:foreach attribute</strong>- This will cause the containing
	tag to be repeated for every row returned in the data block. The
	attribute value can be any valid xpath expression, but is often simply
	'*', which would imply creating a a repeating pattern for every row or
	element returned by the query.
</p>
<h2>Report fields</h2>
<p>Each field in the report is referenced by an xpath expression
	enclosed by curly braces. In its simplest form the xpath xpression can
	be thought of as the name of the field in the database, but when using
	more complex data sources, there is a lot that can be done using this
	syntax. 
  </p>
<p>
  The following shows a typical section of a report that illustrates
  database fields in a report template from the 
</p>
<p>
  In the head section of the .frx file, you will find a series of 
  frx namespaced elements that define special formatting rules. 
</p>
<h2>Other frx Attributes</h2>
<p id="parameters_attr">
	<strong>frx:parameters</strong> when used in conjunction with the
	frx:block attribute overrides the parameters provided to the block that
	is run. When used these values are merged with the values of the
	current data context prior to calling the data block.
</p>
<p id="if">
	<strong>frx:if</strong> attribute determines whether the element will
	be rendered. The normal php rules apply to values specified here
	frx:if="0" evaluates to false, while frx:if="1" evaluates to true.
	Normally you would use token replacement in the attribute to map this
	to some column in the database or xml. For example, frx:if="{mycolumn}"
	would cause this tag and its children only to be rendered if the
	mycolumn field in the database returned true. You may use the
	excalmation point to indicate negation, that is, frx:if="!{my_column}"
	would only evaluate to true if mycolumn was not present or zero.
	Because of the way php string expressions work, listing multiple values
	can be interpreted as an "or". So frx:if="{mycolumn}{yourcolumn}" would
	evalate to true if either database column contained data. If you need
	to use an "and" operator, separate the conditions by "&amp;amp;". So
	frx:if="{mycolumn}&amp;amp;{yourcolumn}" would evaluate to true only if
	both columns evaluated to true.
</p>
<p id="renderer">
	<strong>frx:renderer</strong> uses a custom class to render this
	object. How the tag is rendered is defined by implementation of the
	renderer. See the <a href="#renderers">Provided Renderers</a> section
	for additional information. Typcial syntax looks something like
	frx:renderer="FrxXML".
</p>
<p>Other attributes are interpreted directly from the custom
	renderers section below.</p>
<h2 id="renderers">Provided Renderers</h2>
<h3 id="FrxInclude">FrxInclude</h3>
<p>This renderer includes a another forena report as an asset with
	the approprate tag. The primary use of this renderer is to create
	references to external SVG assets. When rendered in a web page, these
	need to be wrapped in embed tags, but when being included in a PDF
	document the raw SVG should be included. The following attributes are
	supported:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:source</th>
		<td>The site relative forena url to the report asset that needs
			to be rendered. (e.g. reports/sample.state_graph.svg?state=WA ).</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<h3 id="FrxParameterForm">FrxParameterForm</h3>
<p>Place and customize the normal report parameters input form. Use
	it on a div tag anywhere in your report to control exactly where the
	parameter form renders. The renderer supports the following frx
	attributes:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:submit</th>
		<td>The label applied to the submit button</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:title</th>
		<td>The title applied to the parameters fieldset</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:collapsible</th>
		<td>Set to 0 to make the form not collapsible</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:collapsed</th>
		<td>Indicate wether the fieldset is collapsed by default.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>The children of the FrxParmameterForm div allow you to specify
	the exact layout of the parameters form using forena's token
	replacement syntax. The default context is changed to be the rendered
	form so that the parmeter ids will allow replacement of a form control.
</p>
<h3 id="FrxSource">FrxSource</h3>
<p>Display markup as a code snippet. No token replacement is done
	for the children and all embedded code is escaped html. This is used in
	the forena help files to display the source of reports.</p>
<h3 id="FrxSVGGraph">FrxSVGGraph</h3>
<p>Render the node as an SVG graph. The PHP SVGGraph library must be
	installed in order for this renderer to function. The following
	attributes are supported:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:series</th>
		<td>The column containing the series of the graph. Multple series
			may be specified using an attribute of frx:series_1 for the first
			series frx:series_2 as the second and so on.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:path</th>
		<td>The xpath to the data to be graphed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>frx:label</th>
		<td>The label that should be used for the series. Usually this is
			specified in tokens (e.g. {code})</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
	In additons any attributes supported as PHP SVGGraph options may be
	included as frx: attributes. For example, to specify graph colors, you
	can specify frx:color_1="red" and frx:color_2="blue". See the <a
		href="http://www.goat1000.com/svggraph.php"> PHP SVGGraph</a>
	documentation for more info.
</p>
<h3 id="FrxTitle">FrxTitle</h3>
<p>
  Use the content of this tag as the Drupal Title.   This allows both 
  the page title and the tab title to be replaced by token replaced values 
  in the report.
</p>
<h3 id="FrxXML">FrxXML</h3>
<p>
Displays the XML of the current data context and is particularly useful
for debugging purposes. If you embed this in a report, it will show you
the XML data source that is used for token replacement, so it can give
you a good idea as to what data is being returned and which tokens can
be used.
</p>
<h2 id="parameters">Report Parameters</h2>
<p>
Forena is designed to pass url query parameters directly into the SQL queries that
drive the report, however, there are many circumstances where you may want to 
prompt users for specific data prior to generating a report. In such cases you 
can define parameters in the head section of the .frx file as follows: 
</p>
<head frx:renderer="FrxSource">
  <title>My Report Title</title>
  <frx:parameters>
  <frx:parm id="state" label="State" require="1"
    desc="See the parameters tab to understand how this dropdown was created from a data block. "
    data_source="sampledb/states" data_field="" type="select">WA</frx:parm>
  </frx:parameters>
</head>
<p>
  The id of each frx:parm element should match the parameters in the sql data block, 
  and will further control how the user is prompted for each data element. The text contained
  in the frx:parm element defines the "default" value for the parameter. The 
  following attributes are supported in the frx:parm element. 
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>id</th><td>The id of the parameter, which must match what is expected in 
    the data block.  This field is required. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>label</th><td>The label or prompt that the user sees for this parameter</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>desc</th><td>The description provided for each label.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>require</th><td>Set to 1 to require this before form submission</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>type</th><td><p>Type of control to use for prompting the user. Supports 
    the following values:</p>
    <p><strong>textfield</strong> normal text input box (default)
    </p>
    <p><strong>select</strong> - Normal select with a single value.</p>
    <p><strong>multiselect</strong> - Select box with multiple values possbile. 
      Only use this with sql parameters that can be used as arrays or 
      "in"" clauses.
    </p>
    <p><strong>selectajax</strong> - Select with an ajax refresh on every
    selection change.  This is good when you need to to have one select
    statements values dependent on nother.  </p>
    <p><strong>checkbox</strong> - Single checbox returning a value of 0 or 1.</p>
    <p><strong>checkboxes</strong> - Multiple checkboxes that can be used to 
    provide a list of options based on a dat_source. 
    </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>data_source</th><td>The repository/block used to provide values for select,
    radios or checkboxes. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>data_field</th><td>The name of the column from the block that is used for 
    the select value</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>label_field</th><td>The name of the columne from the block that is used for
    the select description.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
