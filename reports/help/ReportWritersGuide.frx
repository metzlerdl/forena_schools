      Forena provides a <strong>What You See Is What You Get </strong>(WYSIWG)
      compatible report editor to make the creation of a basic reports
      very easy. &nbsp;You don't have to know XHTML and CSS to create a
      simple report, but Forena is designed to leverage your html/css
      knowledge, so the more you now about html and css, the more you
      will be able to do with forena.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>Novice users may want to start by creating reports using the
      report editor built into forena. &nbsp;Users with knowledge of
      XHTML, CSS and XML may choose to edit the report defnition files
      directly, or edit reports without the use of the WYSIWYG editor.
      &nbsp;Forena Report XML (frx) reference is provided for those who
      are interested in working on the XHTML files directly. &nbsp;</p>
