This project is under heavy modification, porting it form a standalone postgres 
PHP application to one that runs under drupal.  We are reaching for database 
independence, so much work needs to be done to convert this into an application
that will work either under postgres or mysql.  

--TODO List
Following is a list of items that I don't want to forget to do. 
* Rewrite School and Building validation saves. 
* Add indexes and foreign keys to the schema api.
