This project is under heavy modification, porting it form a standalone postgres 
PHP application to one that runs under drupal.  We are reaching for database

that will work either under postgres or mysql.  

--TODO List
Following is a list of items that I don't want to forget to do. 
* Rewrite School and Building validation saves. 
* Add indexes and foreign keys to the schema api.
